C program simulating a metronome (visual output) with interactive console commands for QNX neutrino RTOS.  
Prints metronome measures to consoles and allows users to pause, stop, start and quit.  
Employed a multi-threaded structure, a timer, and pulses for inter-process communication (IPC).  
Created a QNX resource manager device driver to manage functionality.  
Built for and deployed to a QNX Neutrino RTOS Virtual Machine.
